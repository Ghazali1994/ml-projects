# Overfitting & Regularization

**Dataset**: California Housing dataset from sklearn  
**Problem**: Predict house prices based on features  
**What is Overfitting**: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on test data  
**Fixes Tried**: Ridge and Lasso regularization  
**Key Result**: Regularization reduced test error and simplified the model
